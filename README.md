# Crack_Placement

🚀 45-Day DSA Challenge Completed! 🚀

As a final-year B.Tech student preparing for placements, I took on the Arsh DSA Sheet challenge with consistent daily coding. This challenge helped me fill in gaps in my DSA knowledge and revise key concepts. Here’s how it went:

225/280+ questions solved (78%)
Rank: 178/9912
Easy: 98%, Medium: 83%, Hard: 43%
Key takeaways: 💻 Transitioned from Python to Java
🔍 Moved from brute force to optimized solutions
🌳 Covered topics like DP, Graphs, Trees, Heaps, LinkedLists, Tries, and more!

Consistency is key! Check out the repository where I saved all my solutions:
